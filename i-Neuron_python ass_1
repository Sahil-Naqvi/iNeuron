ASSIGNMENT- 1 

QUESTION STATEMENT - 1
In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be
integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.
*
hellO
39
-87.8
-
/
+
6

SOLUTION STATEMENT - 1
VALUES ARE (hello, 39, -87.8, 6)
EXPRESSION ARE ( *, -, /, +)


QUESTION STATEMENT - 2
What is the difference between string and variable?

SOLUTION STATEMENT - 2
A VARIABLE IS NOTHING BUT THE NAME OF MEMORY LOCATION WHERE DATA IS STORED. VARIABLES CAN BE DEFINED AND NAMED BY US BUT THERE ARE SOME RULES FOR NAMING CONVECTION.
RULE-1 : VARIABLE NAME CAN ONLY START WITH ANY ALPHABET (CAPITAL OR SMALL) OR UNDERSCORE 
RULE-2 : WE CAN NOT USE ANY SPECIAL CHARACTER OTHER THAN UNDERSCORE
RULE-3 : WE CANNNOT NAME ANY KEYWORD AS VARIABLE

STRING IS NOTHING BUT DATA TYPE WHICH REPRESENT ANY SEQUENCE OF CHARACTERS ANYTHING WRITTEN INSIDE DOUBLE QUOTES IS REFFERED AS STRING IT MAY BE INTERGER OR FLOAT IT WILL BE TREATED AS STRING. SO, WE CAN SAY THAT VARIBALE CAN HOLD STRING VALUES BUT VICE-VERSA IS NOT POSSIBLE.


QUESTION STATEMENT - 3
Describe three different data types?

SOLUTION STATEMENT - 3
PYTHON CONSIST OF MANY DATA TYPE LET US TALK ABOUT THREE OF THEM 
1) NUMERIC DATA TYPE: INSIDE NUMERIC DATA TYPE WE HAVE INTEGER (+/-) VALUES, FLOAT (DECIMAL) VALUES, COMPLEX (REAL AND IMAGINARY) VALUES.
2) STRING DATA TYPE: IT IS NOTHING BUT SEQUENCE OF CHARACTERS INSIDE DOUBLE QUOTES.
3) SEQUENCE DATA TYPE: INSIDE SEQUENCE DATA TYPE WE HAVE THREE DIFFERENT DATA TYPES LIST[], TUPLE(), DICTIONARY {}  IN THIS LIST ARE MUTABLE DATA TYPE AND TUPLE ARE IMMUTABLE DATA TYPE AND DICTIIONARY IS KNOWN AS MAPPING DATA TYPE


QUESTION STATEMENT - 4
What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?

SOLUTION STATEMENT - 4
AN EXPRESSION IS NOTHING BUT COMBINATION OF DIFFERENT VALUES AND OPERATORS ALSO SOME VARIABALES. AN EXPRESSION REPRESENT SOME VALUES IN IT AND ALL THEY DO IS PROVIDING SOME MATHEMATICAL CALCULATIONS WHEN WRITTEN UNDER ANY STATEMENT.


QUESTION STATEMENT - 5
This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an
expression and a statement?

SOLUTION STATEMENT - 5
A STATEMENT CONSISIT OF DIFFERNENT EXPRESSIONS. AND COMBINATION OF SUCH STATEMENTS BUILD A PROGRAM. IN THIS EXAMPLE SPAM= 10 IT IS SHOWING THAT SPAM IS A VARIABLE AND 10 IS THE INTERGENR VALUE THAT IS ASSINGNED TO THE THIS VARIBALE IT IS A STATEMENT WITH NO EXPRESSION.


QUESTION STATEMENT - 6
After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1

SOLUTION STATEMENT - 6
23


QUESTION STATEMENT - 7
What should the values of the following two terms be?
'spam' + 'spamspam'
'spam' * 3

SOLUTION STATEMENT - 7
'spamspamspam'
'spamspamspam'


QUESTION STATEMENT - 8
Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?

SOLUTION STATEMENT - 8
VARIABLE NAME CAN ONLY START WITH ANY ALPHABET (CAPITAL OR SMALL) OR UNDERSCORE SO, BECAUSE OF THIS EGGS IS A VALID VARIABLE
WHILE 100 IS NOT A VALID VARIABLE BECAUSE WE CANNOT NAME A VARIABLE OTHER THAN ALPHABET AND UNDERSCORE ONLY.


QUESTION STATEMENT - 9
What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string
version of a value?

SOLUTION STATEMENT - 9
FOR INTEGER WE CAN USE (INT), FOR FLOATING-POINT NUMBER WE CAN USE (FLOAT), FOR STRING WE CAN USE (STR)


QUESTION STATEMENT - 10
Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
'I have eaten'  + 99 +  'burritos.'

SOLUTION STATEMENT - 10
THIS EXPRESSION CAUSE ERROR BECAUSE WE CANNONT DIRECTLY CANCATINATE STRING AND INTEGER HERE WE HAVE TWO STRINGS AND ONE INTEGER VALUE SO IN ORDER TO DEBUG THIS STATEMENT WE NEED TO PUT 99 IN SINGLE QUOTES OR DOUBLE QUOTES ('99') AFTER DOING THIS WE CAN EASILY CONCATINATE THE ABOVE STRING AND FINAL RESULT WILL BE LIKE ' HAVE EATEN 99 BURRITOS'

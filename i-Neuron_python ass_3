ASSIGNMENT- 3

QUESTION STATEMENT - 1
Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?

SOLUTION STATEMENT - 1
THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY FUNCTION ARE ADVANTAGEOUS FOR OUR PROGRAM
1) FOR INCREASING READABILITY OF PROGRAM 
2) HELPS IN AVOIDING DUPLICATION OF CODE IN PROGRAM
3) REDUCE COMPLEXITY OF PROGRAM 
4) INCREASING RE-USABILITY OF PROGRAM 


QUESTION STATEMENT - 2
When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?


SOLUTION STATEMENT - 2
CODE IN A FUCTION IS EXECUTED IF AND ONLY IF WE CALL THAT FUCTION BY NAME. WE HAVE TO CALL THAT FUCTION IF WE WANT TO RUN THE CODE PRESENT INSIDE THE FUNCTION. WE CAN SPECIFY FUCTION ANYWHERE IN OUR CODE, BUT UNTILL AND UNLESS WE CALL THE FUNCTION IT CAN NOT GET EXECUTED.\


QUESTION STATEMENT - 3
What statement creates a function?

SOLUTION STATEMENT - 3
WE CAN CREATE ANY FUNCTION IN PYTHON USING KEYWORD "def(function_name)(arguements):" and we can call the function just by writing the function name.



QUESTION STATEMENT - 4
What is the difference between a function and a function call?


SOLUTION STATEMENT - 4
A FUNCTION IS A STACK OF CODE THAT DOES A PARTICULAR SET OF OPERATIONS AND PROVIDES/RETURN A RESULT. WHILE THE BASIC DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FUNCTION AND FUNCTION CALL IS THAT FUNCTION PROVIDES SOME RESULTS WHILE FUNCTION CALL USES THE FUNCTION TO COMPLETE THAT TASK.


QUESTION STATEMENT - 5
How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?

SOLUTION STATEMENT - 5
IN PYTHON THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF SCOPES(VARIABLES) GLOBAL AND LOCAL. LOCAL VARIABLE IS DEFINED INSIDE THE FUCTION BLOCK AND IT CAN NOT BE USED OUTSIDE OF THAT FUNCTION BLOCK THAT IS WHY WE CALL IT LOCAL VARIABLE(SCOPE). WHILE GLOBAL VARIABLE IS DEFINED IN THE MAIN BODY OF CODE THAT MEANS OUTSIDE OF FUNCTION BLOCK AND CAN BE ACCESSABLE FROM ANWHERE IN THE PROGRAM THAT IS WHY WE CALL IT GLOBAL VARIABLE(SCOPE)


QUESTION STATEMENT - 6
What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?

SOLUTION STATEMENT - 6
WHEN WE CALL THE FUNCTION AND FUNCTION CALL RETURNS LOCAL VARIBALE GETS DESTROYED THAT MEANS AS WHEN WE CALL THE SAME FUNCTION NEXT TIME THE LOCAL SCOPE IS UNABLE TO REMEMBER THE VALUES STORED IN IT.


QUESTION STATEMENT - 7
What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?

SOLUTION STATEMENT - 7
THE ONLY CONCEPT OF HAVING A RETURN VALUE IN A FUNCTION IS THAT WE CAN USE THAT REURN VALUE IN ANY EXPRESSION FOR FURTHER CALCULATIONS IT MAY BE LOGICAL ONE OR BASED ON SOME RESONING.


QUESTION STATEMENT - 8
If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?

SOLUTION STATEMENT - 8
IF THE FUNCTION DOES NOT HAVE A RETURN STATEMENT THEN BY DEFAULT IT WILL GIVE "NONE" AS RETURN VALUE.



QUESTION STATEMENT - 9
How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?

SOLUTION STATEMENT - 9
THIS IS A SIMPLE TASK JUST ADD KEYWORD "global" BEFORE THAT LOCAL VARIABALE NAME AT THE START OF THE FUNCTION. THIS KEYWORD WILL HELP THE FUNCTION TO REFER TO GLOBAL VARIABALE WHENEVER ACCESSED.



QUESTION STATEMENT - 10
What is the data type of None?

SOLUTION STATEMENT - 10
DATA TYPE OF "None" IS "NoneType".


QUESTION STATEMENT - 11
What does the sentence import areallyourpetsnamederic do?

SOLUTION STATEMENT - 11
IMPORT STATEMENT HELPS IN IMPORTING DIFFERENT MODULES IN PYTHON. BUT THIS STATEMENT IS NOT A CORRECT PYTHON MODULE.


QUESTION STATEMENT - 12
If you had a bacon() feature in a spam module, what would you call it after importing spam?

SOLUTION STATEMENT - 12
WE CAN CALL THIS FUNCTION BY WRITING spam.bacon()



QUESTION STATEMENT - 13
What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error?

SOLUTION STATEMENT - 13
WE CAN USE EXCEPTION HANDLING TO SAVE A PROGRAM FROM CRASHING IT MAY ENCOUNTER ANY ERROR.


QUESTION STATEMENT - 14
What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?


SOLUTION STATEMENT - 14
THE MAIN FUCTION OF TRY AND EXCEPT CLAUSE IS TO DO EXCEPTION HANDLING. THE MAIN PURPOSE OF TRY BLOCK IS TO TRY THE CODE WITH SOME EXCEPTIONS TO CHECK IF THERE IS EXCEPTION RAISED THAN EXCEPT CLAUSE COMES INTO ACTION AND THIS CLAUSE IS ONLY EXECUTED IF AND ONLY IF ANY EXCEPTION IS OCCURED IN TRY CLAUSE.
